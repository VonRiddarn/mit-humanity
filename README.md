# MIT - Humanity
Version 1.2 - March 20, 2025  

## Reason for existence
The MIT - Humanity license was created to balance the open-source freedom provided through the original MIT license with a strong commitment to user rights and ethical software practices.  
My goal is to encourage developers to build software that not only respects the freedom to use, modify and share, but also the rights of those who will be using it in the end.  
Unlike the MIT license, this license may never be accepted into the Open Source Initiative as it potentially limit fields of endeavor.  

## The license
Copyright (c) [year] [your name]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  

### Section 1: Standard Terms  

1.1:  
The above copyright notice and the entirety of this license (including all terms, conditions, and permissions stated herein) shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.  

1.2:  
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.  

### Section 2: Humanity Provisions  
In addition to the terms of Section 1, the following conditions apply to any distribution, publication, or deployment of the Software, or any derivative works of the Software:  

2.1:  
If you release or distribute the Software (or a derivative) in a manner that requires end users to perform additional actions in order to access or use the Software (including but not limited to creating an account or paying a fee), you must not:  
* Misrepresent or omit material facts about these actions.
* Use false, unclear, or deceptive language to encourage or enforce these actions.

2.2:  
If your use or distribution of the Software requires end users to create an account:  
* End users must be provided with a clear and direct way to delete their account from within the Software or service, without requiring interaction with customer service representatives, support teams, or similar intermediaries.
* Account deletion must include deletion of all user data associated with the account, unless retention is required by law.
* The option to delete an account and its data must be clearly visible and accessible within the user interface of the Software or service.

2.3:  
If the use or distribution of the Software requires payment of a recurring fee:  
* End users must be provided with a clear and direct way to cancel or unsubscribe from such fees from within the Software or service itself, without requiring interaction with customer service representatives, support teams, or similar intermediaries.
* The method to cancel recurring fees must be clearly visible and accessible within the user interface of the Software or service.
* If the software requires a fee to access or use and the end user is presented with a free trial period, the free trial will not automatically start a recurring fee unless the user makes a deliberate action to continue using the service (e.g., accessing their account, entering payment information) within seven (7) days after the trial period ends. Payment information entered before or during the trial period does not count. If the end user is prompted to enter their payment information after the trial period, it must be explicitly stated in simple terms that this will result in a recurring fee.

2.4:  
The mechanisms required under Sections 2.2 and 2.3 must:  
* Be designed in a way that an average user can understand and complete without unnecessary difficulty.
* Avoid the use of deceptive patterns (also known as 'dark patterns') within the mechanisms for account deletion and fee cancellation.
  
### Section 3: Enforcement and Interpretation  
* Violation of any condition in Section 2 terminates your rights under this license, unless the violation is corrected within a reasonable period after notice.
* Terms such as “clear,” “direct,” and “easy” shall be interpreted in accordance with commonly accepted user experience (UX) principles and best practices.

### Section 4: Disclaimer  
As stated in Section 1, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
